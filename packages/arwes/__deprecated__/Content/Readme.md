Block container to give styles to HTML static content elements.

If you need to use specific elements you can refer to the
[Arwes static components](/api).

```javascript
<Content>
    <h1>Arwes</h1>
    <p>Futuristic Sci-Fi and <a href='/cyberpunk'>Cyberpunk</a>
    Graphical User Interface Framework for Web Apps</p>
</Content>
```

This component is useful as article content containers so you don't
have to use specific React components for content elements such as headings
or paragraphs.

General styles are still applied by `<Arwes />`.
