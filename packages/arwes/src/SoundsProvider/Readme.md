Sounds provider process the sounds to play and rain them down to the child
components with the HOC `withSounds` so they may use them.

In the Arwes built-in components the sounds are optional, they check if the players
are provided to play them, so this provider is optional for Arwes components.

More sounds can be configured with `createSounds` tool and passed to the provider
so any child component can use them.

Go to [Sounds System](/docs/sounds-system) for more details.
