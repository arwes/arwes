`<SoundsProvider />` process the sounds provided to play and rain them down to the
child components with the HOC `withSounds()` so they may use them.

In the Arwes built-in components the sounds are optional, they check if the players
are provided to play them, so this provider is optional for Arwes components.

More sounds can be configured with `createSounds()` tool and passed to the provider
so any child component can use them.
