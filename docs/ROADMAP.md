## 2014 - 2018

From 2014 to 2018 the project was released in alpha versions where the main
ideas have been tested out in projects. Though many features were limited, have
little support / extensibility, or buggy. The plan was to gather enough insight
to decide and build the foundation of the framework.

## 2019

### Q1

- [x] Define and implement a new project architecture to improve organization,
simplify tooling, and facilitate developers contributions.
- [x] Complete started animation and sounds guidelines. These guidelines will
establish the ground concepts for the framework to work.
- [x] Research and playground new ideas and concepts to implement in the project
with the [soulextract.com](https://github.com/soulextract/soulextract.com) side
project. The results are going to be used in Arwes.

### Q2

- Animation System.
    - [x] Create an animation specification to define the animation system architecture.
    - [x] Document React components APIs to create animation systems.
- Sounds System.
    - [x] Create a sounds specification to define the sound system architecture.
    - [x] Develop the `@arwes/sounds` package with the sounds system APIs.
    - [x] Document React components APIs to create sounds systems.

### Q3

- [x] Complete started purpose guideline document. This will clarify what
the vision of the project is.
- Animation System.
    - [x] Define animation system architecture specification.
    - [x] Update animation specification with complex animation flow scenearios.
    - [x] Develop the `@arwes/animation` package with the animation system APIs.

### Q4

- Animation System.
    - [x] Create animation management components.
    - [x] Create unit and group animation components.
