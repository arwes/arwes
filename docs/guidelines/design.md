Arwes is a _framework_ to create UIs. Ideally, most settings should be configurable.
So many of these guidelines should be flexible enough to adapt to the implementation
desired.

## Colors

Futuristic designs tend to be dark. Arwes is not an exception, it is specially
designed for dark backgrounds and light elements. But it could be configured
to meet alternative requirements.

## Fonts

The typographies tend to be rectangular and maybe oblique with techno influence.

Text, as any other content, should have the ability to "glow". This effect is
achieved with `text-shadow` and it is defined according to the type of content
and user interaction.

Arwes defines three main typographies: Headings, content, and code. You can
configure all of them along with their scales.

The project uses [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
and [Electrolize](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Electrolize).
