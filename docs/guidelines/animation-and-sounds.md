A system is a tree of nodes with only one parent.

Any node in a system can use animations for many purposes, as individual
nodes or sub-systems of nodes.

A node can be animated or not. An animated node should animate its children.
A non-animated node should not animate its children.

If a node is animated, it can play sounds. Otherwise, it should not play sounds.

When multiple nodes play the same sound at the same time, the sound can be played
only once. If a sound is playing and another node tries to play it again,
the sound restarts.

## Transitions

When an node transitions in the system, it should be assembled. It should
feel as being created part by part. A simple line will start as a point and
get its final length over a short period of time. Opacity can be used from 0 to 1
while animating but should last very short in the beginning of the animation.

When a node transitions out of the system, it should be disassembled. It should
feel as if it is being unmounted part by part. A simple line will shrink until
it is a point in a short period of time. Opacity can be used from 1 to 0 while
animating, but should last very short at the end of the animation.

Nodes transitioning in and out can have a sound effect lasting the time the
animations take.

When a system transitions in, nodes should transition in by their order of
depth. From parent nodes to children nodes. For example, first backgrounds,
then structural frames, then containers, and finally content. All nodes in
the same depth start transitioning in at the same time and should take the
same duration.

The duration of a transition should be around 200 milliseconds.

A system can take as many levels as needed. It is recommended to have as few as
possible. A typical system can take 5 levels of depth.

When a system transitions out, all nodes regardless of their level of depth,
should start transitioning out at the same time and should take the same duration.

All nodes in a system should support being animated or not. A non-animated node
should not have transition animations.

## Persistency

In a system, once it is assembled and shown, it can run randomly subtle passive
animations on its nodes regularly with very optional sounds.

Lines in a rectangular container can glow momentary in a system. A background
can be animated the whole time with subtle changes, and low dim music can be
played in the duration of the system.

But these animations should not be intrusive. User should not be distracted from
primary content.

## Interactions

When an external factor interacts with nodes in the system (such as user mouse
or keyboard, or real time notification), the nodes can affect themselves, such
as a toggle (changing from on to off and vice-versa), or they can affect a
sub-system, such as expanding information on hover or transitioning to another
system.

For subtle interactions, like hovering a node or typing a key, subtle animations
and sounds can be played. These should not bring too much attention.

For decisive interactions, like selecting an option or typing enter, more concise
animations and sounds can be played. These should bring attention.
