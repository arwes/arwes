## When Arwes will be ready for production?

Arwes is currently in _alpha_ version. It means there is ongoing development,
APIs and guidelines can change and have breaking changes.

The project will be ready for production when it has a stable and tested API.

See [roadmap](./roadmap) for more details.

## What is the status of the development?

Arwes is being worked on packages. Functional packages and design implementation
packages. The guidelines are used as the main concepts behind them.

The functional packages should be ready and the guidelines defined for the design
implementation packages to be developed.

In the [project page](/project), each package should have a badge indicating
its current status.

## [arwes.dev](https://arwes.dev) website is outdated and where is the source code?

Currently, the website shows the documentation for **Arwes v1.0.0-alpha.5** with
source code for the project and the website from this repository at branch **[`version1-breakpoint1`](https://github.com/arwes/arwes/tree/version1-breakpoint1)**.

The branch [`main`](https://github.com/arwes/arwes) is at current development
with major breaking changes.

## Can I use it in React Native and other environments?

Arwes version 1.x is intended to support only web environments with latest
technologies.

Though the project may offer support for other environments in future versions.

You can use tools to embed the web apps into other environments such as
mobile with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or [Electron](https://electronjs.org)
in desktop, or simply make it a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps).

## What about Arwes for AR/VR?

Since we can build AR/VR apps for the web, Arwes can be used for such projects.
But for Arwes version 1.0, there is no plan to build/test specific tools for
that.

Once the project is stable, we can start defining how Arwes can be implemented
for AR/VR.

## What browsers are supported?

Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari for Android, iOS and desktop.

## Does Arwes only work with [React](https://reactjs.org)?

Since [React](https://reactjs.org) is a library with component logic written
in JavaScript, we could "easily" use React components with other frameworks or
vanilla JavaScript. Not all features will be supported. Additional setup
is required.

## Why Arwes uses [JSS](https://cssinjs.org) as a styling solution?

[JSS](https://cssinjs.org) is an excellent _CSS in JavaScript_ implementation
with pretty robust benefits for scalable component tools in JavaScript.

React framework) uses JSS for its [customization](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics)
strategy.

## What about SSR or the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org)?

Arwes is built in tools that can be easily setup for server-side rendering (SSR)
or used as static generated markup/JavaScript sites as the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org),
so definitely you can use Arwes with [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) or [Next](https://nextjs.org).

But Arwes requires a few more setup steps to make it work for such requirements
due to its design, sound, and animation systems.

There is a plan to document complete examples.

## Can I build SEO-friendly sites with Arwes?

Arwes is a framework with rich sound and animations effects so there are a few
extra considerations to take for SEO sites/apps. But definitely, the sites built
with Arwes can be SEO-friendly.

There is a plan to document these.

## Is there a plan to build more specific tools?

There are ideas to add grid layouts, custom form controls, graph, and map tools
with Arwes customization but not for version 1.0.
