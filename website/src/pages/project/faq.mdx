# Frequently Asked Questions

## When will Arwes be ready for production?

Arwes is currently in [alpha release](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40067469).
It means there is ongoing development with breaking changes. APIs and guidelines
can change as they get completed.

The project will be ready for production when it has a stable and tested API.

See [roadmap](/project/roadmap) for more details.

## What is the development status?

The project is delivered as [NPM packages](/develop) based on specific
[UI/UX guidelines](/project/guidelines).

The packages are categorized by **functional packages**, functionalities which power
the UI component system, and **implementation packages**, design system or visual
design component implementations. The functional packages and the guidelines
should be completed for the implementation packages to be developed.

In the [develop page](/develop), each package should have a badge indicating
its current status.

for more specific details.

## What happened to the previous version of the website [arwes.dev](https://arwes.dev)?

The previous version was moved to [version1-breakpoint1.arwes.dev](https://version1-breakpoint1.arwes.dev)
with the branch [`version1-breakpoint1`](https://github.com/arwes/arwes/tree/version1-breakpoint1)
where you can find the components and the website source code. This package was released
in February, 2018, and **it is now deprecated**.

The latest version at branch [`main`](https://github.com/arwes/arwes) is the current
active development with major breaking changes.

## Can I use it in React Native and other environments?

Arwes version 1.x is intended to support only web environments with latest
technologies.

The project may offer support for other environments in future versions.

You can use tools to embed the web apps into other environments such as
mobile with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or [Electron](https://electronjs.org)
in desktop, or simply make it a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps).

## What about Arwes for AR/VR?

Since we can build AR/VR apps for the web now, Arwes can be used for such projects.
But for Arwes version 1.0, there is no plan to build/test specific tools for
that.

Once the project is stable, we can start defining how Arwes can be implemented
for AR/VR.

## What browsers are supported?

Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, for Android, iOS and desktop.

> Testing is still in progress.

## Does Arwes only work with [React](https://reactjs.org)?

Since [React](https://reactjs.org) is a library with component logic written
in JavaScript, we could "easily" use React components with other frameworks or
vanilla JavaScript with additional setup.

But Arwes components are highly interconnected with each other so many features
would not work.

For version 1.x, the project is recommended to be used only in React projects.

## What about SSR or the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org)?

Arwes is built in tools that can be easily setup for server-side rendering (SSR)
or used as static generated markup/JavaScript sites as the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org),
so definitely you can use Arwes with [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) or [Next](https://nextjs.org).

But Arwes requires a few more setup steps to make it work for such requirements
due to its design, sound, and animation systems.

> There is a plan to document complete examples.

## Can I build SEO-friendly sites with Arwes?

Arwes is a framework with rich sound and animations effects so there are a few
extra considerations to take for SEO sites/apps. But definitely, the sites built
with Arwes can be SEO-friendly.

> There is a plan to document these.

## Is there a plan to build more specific tools?

There are ideas to add grid layouts, custom form controls, graph, and map tools
with Arwes customization but not for version 1.0.

## Why does Arwes use CSSinJS as a styling solution?
