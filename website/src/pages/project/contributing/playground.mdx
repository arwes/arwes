# Contributing to the playground

> The playground application is still under development.

The [playground](https://playground.arwes.dev) is a web application to experiment
and test the framework tools and components in real-time in local environment
and also to preview the framework functionalities in production environment.

It is similar to [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) but with custom user experience.

Each tool or component can have sandboxes which represent isolated examples
or use cases. The sandboxes are written in markdown JavaScript JSX snippets so
they are executed in runtime instead of compilation time.

The playground is basically a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) web application
written in JavaScript listing the tools and components sandboxes and letting
the user choose which one to render.

## Setting up

The repository has to be set up first. See [workflow instructions](/project/contributing/workflow).

Then the playground can be installed:

```bash
# at root folder
cd playground
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
# at root folder
cd playground
npm run develop
```

It is automatically reloaded when any of the sandboxes files are updated.

## Sandboxes

Each sandbox file has to follow the following file path:

```text
packages/[PACKAGE]/src/[COMPONENT]/[COMPONENT].[SANDBOX].sandbox.md
```

For example. Package name `core`, component name `Button`, and sandbox name `basic`
will be located at:

```text
packages/core/src/Button/Button.basic.sandbox.md
```

All package tools/components have to have a `basic` sandbox.

The sandbox file is a markdown file with a JavaScript JSX snippet containing the
example or use case code. Sandboxes have available all the Arwes packages
and some external libraries. This information is detailed in the application
information.

All sandboxes files are imported as text files and listed in a "playground config"
file. According to the selected sandbox in the application, the respective source
code is rendered in runtime.

## Update Workflow

Once a package component is updated, the playground application will require the
source code to be compiled in CommonJS.

```bash
# at root folder
npm run compile-commonjs
```
