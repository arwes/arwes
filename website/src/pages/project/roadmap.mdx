# Roadmap

> _**Last updated: March 20, 2021**_

Tasks are listed with their respective details in the [project boards](https://github.com/arwes/arwes/projects).

The order in the lists does not exactly represent priority, order, neither execution.

The roadmap is subject to changes according to the development progress.
