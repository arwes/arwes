# Develop

The framework is delivered for the web platform as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) packages
in the `@arwes/[package]` scope for [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS)
and [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) formats in JavaScript ES5.

The packages source code is written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
and on top of tools like [React](https://reactjs.org), [Emotion](https://emotion.sh),
[Anime](https://animejs.com), and [Howler](https://howlerjs.com).

Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, for Android, iOS and desktop are supported.

The framework packages are categorized by functional packages and implementation packages.

## Functional Packages

The main functionalities which power the UI component system. They can be used to

to solve.
