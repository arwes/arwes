# `@arwes/design`

Theming and styling tools with focus in [Emotion](https://emotion.sh) in [React](https://reactjs.org).

The design tools are heavily inspired by [Material UI](https://material-ui.com).

## Installation

All the tools are bundled and can be installed with the following NPM package:

```bash
npm install @arwes/design
```

The design management tooling requires [`polished`](https://polished.js.org)
v4 as a peer-dependency.

```bash
npm install polished@4
```

## Theme

Any application can have a design definition managed by a theme. A theme is a set
of visual configurations and utilities. Application components can make use of
it to create their styles and animations.

A theme with default settings can be created like:

```tsx
import { createTheme } from '@arwes/design';

const theme = createTheme();
```

The following features can be configured:

- [Breakpoints](/develop/design/breakpoints).
- [Palette](/develop/design/palette).
- [Multipliers](/develop/design/multipliers).

But any extra settings can be setup as needed.

Then the theme can be used in any CSS-in-JS library theme provider or referenced
directly by components to generate dynamic styles and animations.

### Theme Extension

A new theme can be created by extending a previously created one.

```tsx
const theme1 = createTheme({ ... });
const theme2 = createTheme({ ... }, theme1);
```

The second theme will extend the first theme.
