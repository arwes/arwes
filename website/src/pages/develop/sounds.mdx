# `@arwes/sounds`

Define, manage, and control interactive sound effects using [Howler](https://howlerjs.com)
in [React](https://reactjs.org).

Based on the [UI/UX guidelines](/project/guidelines), the sounds tools can be
used for application interface sounds management. Futuristic science fiction
user interfaces usually execute short experiential sounds such as beeps, bleeps,
processing loops, glitches, and chimes, on [events](/project/guidelines/events)
or [state transitions](/project/guidelines/states).

These tools are not intended for sounds with long durations such as music songs.

The sounds tools require the [React](https://reactjs.org) component tree to
allow the dynamic communication between components and [Howler](https://howlerjs.com)
for sound management.

It goes hand in hand with the [animation tools](/develop/animation), though
it is not a dependency.

It is advised to follow the [Sound Accessibility](/develop/sounds/accessibility)
recommendations.

## Installation

All the tools are bundled and can be installed with the following NPM package:

```bash
npm install @arwes/sounds
```

The sounds management tooling requires React v17 and Howler v2.2 as peer-dependencies.

```bash
npm install react@17 react-dom@17 prop-types howler@2.2
```

In TypeScript, the following type packages are needed:

```bash
npm install @types/react@17 @types/react-dom@17 @types/howler@2.2
```

## Bleeps

A short sound used in Arwes application components is called a bleep. Bleeps can
be used on user events such as user interactions, application events such as
notifications, or animation flow transitions on specific components along with
the [animation tools](/develop/animation).

## Providers

Since bleeps in an application are shared among its components, there needs to be
a global data provider of the audio settings, player settings, and bleeps settings.
With the configured settings, the provider creates the bleeps to provide to the
components.

### Audio Settings

The audio settings define the general audio sound settings which are normally
transversal for sound control in an application. They can be applicable to all bleeps
and to [categories of bleeps](/develop/sounds/categories).

For example, enabling all sounds with an specific volume can be set in a application
component like:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { BleepsProvider, BleepsAudioSettings } from '@arwes/sounds';

const audioSettings: BleepsAudioSettings = {
  common: {
    volume: 0.5, // default 1
    disabled: false // default false
  }
};

const App: FC = ({ children }) => (
  <BleepsProvider audioSettings={audioSettings}>
    {children}
  </BleepsProvider>
);
```

Sound volume can go from `0` to `1`.

If sounds are disabled, no bleeps are passed to the components.

### Players Settings

A player settings define the sound file data.

In an application component example, the players could be configured like:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { BleepsProvider, BleepsPlayersSettings } from '@arwes/sounds';

const playersSettings: BleepsPlayersSettings = {
  click: { // On user click.
    src: ['/path/to/sounds/click.mp3']
  },
  type: { // Text typing loop sound.
    src: ['/path/to/sounds/type.mp3'],
    loop: true
  }
};

const App: FC = ({ children }) => (
  <BleepsProvider playersSettings={playersSettings}>
    {children}
  </BleepsProvider>
);
```

The `click` player will use the file `click.mp3` in MP3 format.

The `type` player will use the file `type.mp3` in MP3 format as a loop sound.
It means that the player will play in a loop until explicitely stopped.

## Bleeps Settings

The bleeps settings define which player to use and audio settings to use.

Based on the application example players settings, the bleeps can be
configured like:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { BleepsProvider, BleepsSettings } from '@arwes/sounds';

const bleepsSettings: BleepsSettings = {
  tap: {
    player: 'click'
  },
  typing: {
    player: 'type'
  }
};

const App: FC = ({ children }) => (
  <BleepsProvider bleepsSettings={bleepsSettings}>
    {children}
  </BleepsProvider>
);
```

The bleep names can be the same or different from the player names.
There can be multiple bleeps based on the same player settings.

The bleeps can also have [categories](/develop/sounds/categories).

## Consumers

A React component can consume bleeps using the `useBleeps` React hook.

It requires a parent `BleepsProvider` with bleeps settings to receive the
generated bleeps. In case there is no provider found, an empty bleeps object
is returned.

A bleep is a sound player and implements the audio settings applicable.

Assuming a `tap` bleep provided by a parent provider, a button component can
use it like this:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { useBleeps } from '@arwes/sounds';

const ButtonComponent: FC = ({ children }) => {
  const bleeps = useBleeps();
  const onClick = () => bleeps.tap.play();
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

A complete example can look like this:

```arwes_sandbox
const SOUND_CLICK_URL = 'https://playground.arwes.dev/assets/sounds/click.mp3';

const Button = ({ children }) => {
  const bleeps = useBleeps();
  const onClick = () => bleeps.tap.play();
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};

function App () {
  const audioSettings = {
    common: {
      volume: 0.5
    }
  };
  const playersSettings = {
    click: {
      src: [SOUND_CLICK_URL]
    }
  };
  const bleepsSettings = {
    tap: {
      player: 'click'
    }
  };

  return (
    <BleepsProvider
      audioSettings={audioSettings}
      playersSettings={playersSettings}
      bleepsSettings={bleepsSettings}
    >
      <Button>Bleep!</Button>
    </BleepsProvider>
  );
}

render(<App />);
```

If the applicable audio settings disable the bleep, the sound will not be available
in the component. So if the component should work with enabled/disabled bleeps,
it should check if it exists before using it. You may use
[optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)
for that.

If the bleep is enabled and the player `click` does not exist, it will throw an error.

## Shared Sounds

By default, bleeps are shared by all components. It means that if any of the
component instances try to play or stop the sound, it would be the same
bleep sound. The same goes for all the other bleep API methods.

Since an intensive application can have hundreds or thousands of component instances
with different sounds, if the sounds were created each time, it would highly
compromise performance.

## Preloading

Bleeps are preloaded on creation time, not on definition time. So the sounds
would be loaded when the provider is mounted.

> Functionalities for custom sound loading are still in progress.

## Recommended Audio Formats

As recommended by [howlerjs](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js#format-recommendations):

> "If your goal is to have the best balance of small filesize and high quality,
based on extensive production testing, your best bet is to default to `webm` and
fallback to `mp3`. `webm` has nearly full browser coverage with a great combination
of compression and quality. You'll need the `mp3` fallback for Internet Explorer."

Since Arwes is not supported in Internet Explorer out of the box, the recommendation
is to use `webm` audio format.
