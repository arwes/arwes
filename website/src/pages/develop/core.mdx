# `@arwes/core`

Framework core set of components.

It contains the main components to build an standard Arwes user interface.

It depends on the [design](/develop/design), [animation](/develop/animation),
and [sounds](/develop/sounds) packages.

## Installation

All the tools are bundled and can be installed with the following NPM packages:

```bash
npm install @arwes/design @arwes/animation @arwes/sounds @arwes/core
```

The Arwes packages require the following peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install react@17 react-dom@17 prop-types @emotion/css@11 @emotion/react@11 polished@4 animejs@3 howler@2.2
```

In TypeScript, the following type packages are needed:

```bash
npm install @types/react@17 @types/react-dom@17 @types/animejs@3 @types/howler@2.2
```

## Components

The guides and API documentation for the core components is still under development.

All the available components previews and examples can be tested in the
playground sandboxes in the `@arwes/core` package.

See: [playground.arwes.dev](https://playground.arwes.dev/core/StylesBaseline/basic).

## Example

A similar example as the sandbox [playground.arwes.dev/core/Figure/basic](https://playground.arwes.dev/core/Figure/basic)
can be replicated in a local project like:

```tsx
import React, { FC, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { AnimatorGeneralProvider, Animator } from '@arwes/animation';
import { BleepsProvider } from '@arwes/sounds';
import { ArwesThemeProvider, StylesBaseline, Text, Figure } from '@arwes/core';

// For the font-family to work, you would have to setup the Google Fonts link:
// <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Titillium+Web:wght@300;400;600&display=swap" />

const ROOT_FONT_FAMILY = '"Titillium Web", sans-serif';
const IMAGE_URL = 'https://playground.arwes.dev/assets/images/wallpaper.jpg';
const SOUND_OBJECT_URL = 'https://playground.arwes.dev/assets/sounds/object.mp3';
const SOUND_TYPE_URL = 'https://playground.arwes.dev/assets/sounds/type.mp3';

const audioSettings = { common: { volume: 0.25 } };
const playersSettings = {
  object: { src: [SOUND_OBJECT_URL] },
  type: { src: [SOUND_TYPE_URL], loop: true }
};
const bleepsSettings = {
  object: { player: 'object' },
  type: { player: 'type' }
};
const generalAnimator = { duration: { enter: 200, exit: 200 } };

const App: FC = () => {
  const [activate, setActivate] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => setActivate(!activate), 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
  }, [activate]);

  return (
    <ArwesThemeProvider>
      <StylesBaseline styles={{ body: { fontFamily: ROOT_FONT_FAMILY } }} />
      <BleepsProvider
        audioSettings={audioSettings}
        playersSettings={playersSettings}
        bleepsSettings={bleepsSettings}
      >
        <AnimatorGeneralProvider animator={generalAnimator}>
          <Animator animator={{ activate, manager: 'stagger' }}>
            <Text as='h1'>
              Nebula
            </Text>
            <Text as='p'>
              A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and
              other ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe any
              diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky
              Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as
              the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral
              nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the
              early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.
            </Text>
            <Figure
              src={IMAGE_URL}
              alt='A nebula'
            >
              A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and
              other ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe

              the Milky Way.

              Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in
              diameter. A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth
              would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The Orion
              Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area
              twice the angular diameter of the full Moon, can be viewed with
              the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers. Although denser
              than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense
              than any vacuum created on Earth â€“ a nebular cloud the size of the
              Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms.
            </Text>
          </Animator>
        </AnimatorGeneralProvider>
      </BleepsProvider>
    </ArwesThemeProvider>
  );
};

// Assuming there is a HTML element with id "root".
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```

Other playground sandboxes can be replicated in a similar way.

> Since the components are still development, their API is most likely to change
over the releases. It is not recommended to use them for real projects yet.
