# Breakpoints

The breakpoints tools are a simplified version of the [Material specification](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints).

> "A breakpoint is the range of predetermined screen sizes that have specific
layout requirements. At a given breakpoint range, the layout adjusts to suit
the screen size and orientation."

The theme object defines breakpoints for 6 screen ranges with the following
default values:

- `xs` (extra small) of `0px`.
- `sm` (small) of `600px`.
- `md` (medium) of `960px`.
- `lg` (large) of `1280px`.
- `xl` (extra large) of `1920px`.

They can be configured with different values optionally:

```tsx
import { createTheme } from '@arwes/design';

const theme = createTheme({
  // In this case, the "small" and "medium" breakpoints
  // are updated accordingly.
  breakpoints: {
    values: {
      sm: 400,
      md: 768
    }
  }
});
```

These breakpoints values can be used to create [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries)
dynamically. The breakpoints functions can be executed in the components dynamic
styles generation to add specific media queries or browser utilities like
[matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia).

## Breakpoint Up

To create a media query from one breakpoint upwards:

```tsx
theme.breakpoints.up('lg');
// '@media screen and (min-width: 1920px)'
```

Upwards large using default values.

## Breakpoint Down

To create a media query from one breakpoint downwards minus `1`:

```tsx
theme.breakpoints.down('lg');
// '@media screen and (max-width: 1919px)'
```

Downwards large breakpoint using default values.

## Only Breakpoint

To create a media query between the provided breakpoint and just before the next:

```tsx
theme.breakpoints.only('sm');
// '@media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 959px)'
```

From small to medium range using default values.

## Between Breakpoints

To create a media query between two provided breakpoints:

```tsx
theme.breakpoints.between('md', 'lg');
// '@media screen and (min-width: 960px) and (max-width: 1919px)'
```

From medium to large range using default values.
