# `@arwes/animation`

Assemble and disassemble user interfaces using animation controls in [React](https://reactjs.org).

Based on the [UI/UX guidelines](/project/guidelines), the animation tools can be
used to manage and control [animation flows](/project/guidelines/states) in
applications. Then the specific components animations or components events can
be defined more easily, such as visual effects or sound playbacks when a
component transition from one state to another.

The animation tools require the [React](https://reactjs.org) component tree to
allow the dynamic communication between components.

It goes hand in hand with the [sounds tools](/develop/sounds), though it is not
a dependency.

## Installation

All the tools are bundled and can be installed with the following NPM package:

```bash
npm install @arwes/animation
```

The animation management tooling requires React v17 as a peer-dependency.

```bash
npm install react@17
npm install react-dom@17
npm install prop-types
```

In TypeScript, the following type packages are needed:

```bash
npm install @types/react@17
npm install @types/react-dom@17
```

## Animators

Any React component can have animation controls and be added to the
[Arwes system](/project/guidelines/systems) by using the `<Animator/>` component.

The `<Animator/>` component will work as an animated node in the system. It will
be interconnected by sharing data and communicating with its parent and
children counterparts.

Normally, the `withAnimator` [higher-order component (HOC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)
will handle the animator component setup instead of the component itself.
So class/function components with specific initial settings can be created.

A HTML button component can be animated like:

```tsx
import React, { FC, useRef, MutableRefObject } from 'react';
import { AnimatorRef, AnimatorClassSettings, withAnimator } from '@arwes/animation';

interface ButtonProps {
  // An animated component will receive the `animator` prop with
  // the animator API.
  animator: AnimatorRef
}

const ButtonComponent: FC<ButtonProps> = props => {
  const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);

  // Here you can set any kind of data you want to pass to the
  // animator "animate hooks". In this case, a HTML button ref.
  props.animator.setupAnimateRefs(buttonRef);

  return (
    <button ref={buttonRef}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
};

// "enter" is the duration to transition from exited to entering to entered.
// "exit" is the duration to transition from entered to exiting to exited.
const duration = { enter: 200, exit: 200 };

const useAnimateEntering = (
  animator: AnimatorRef,
  buttonRef: MutableRefObject<HTMLButtonElement>
): void => {
  // On flow entering:
  // You can animate the references passed as the second parameter.
};

const useAnimateExiting = (
  animator: AnimatorRef,
  buttonRef: MutableRefObject<HTMLButtonElement>
): void => {
  // On flow exiting:
  // You can animate the references passed as the second parameter.
};

const animatorClassSettings: AnimatorClassSettings = {
  duration,
  useAnimateEntering,
  useAnimateExiting
};

const Button = withAnimator(animatorClassSettings)(ButtonComponent);

export { ButtonProps, Button };
```

The new wrapped component `<Button/>` by the HOC will have animations
enabled and it will handle when to call the animate hooks on flow transitions.

But this component will not execute any HTML/CSS animations on its elements,
so we need to check how to add them in the animate hooks.

## Animate Hooks

An animator will only handle the flow transitions and flow control management.
The actual HTML elements animations should be handled inside the animate hooks.

By setting up the references to the HTML elements inside the component render
with `props.animator.setupAnimateRefs()`, the hooks can receive them for
manipulations.

The HTML elements animations can be made with any HTML animation library.
Recommended libraries are [animejs](https://animejs.com) and [GreenSock](https://greensock.com).

If the example `<Button/>` component should have animations:

- To enter the flow with opacity from `0` to `1` and time `duration.enter`.
- To exit the flow with opacity from `1` to `0` and time `duration.exit`.

They could be written like this using [animejs](https://animejs.com):

```tsx
import anime from 'animejs';

// ...

const useAnimateEntering = (
  animator: AnimatorRef,
  buttonRef: MutableRefObject<HTMLButtonElement>
): void => {
  anime({
    targets: buttonRef.current,
    duration: animator.duration.enter,
    easing: 'linear',
    opacity: [0, 1]
  });
};

const useAnimateExiting = (
  animator: AnimatorRef,
  buttonRef: MutableRefObject<HTMLButtonElement>
): void => {
  anime({
    targets: buttonRef.current,
    duration: animator.duration.exit,
    easing: 'linear',
    opacity: [1, 0]
  });
};

// ...
```

When the flow enters, it would go from hidden to visible. When the flow exits,
it will reverse it.

There is a hook for all the flow states transitions and the component mounting
and unmounting lifecycles.

- `useAnimateMount` - On component mount.
- `useAnimateEntering` - On flow entering.
- `useAnimateEntered` - On flow entered.
- `useAnimateExiting` - On flow exiting.
- `useAnimateExited` - On flow exited.
- `useAnimateUnmount` - On component unmount.

Now, according to how the component is used, it will behave in a certain way.

## Parent/Children Nodes

By default, if the component is used alone or if it does not have parent
counterparts, then it is considered a root component, unless configured otherwise.

If the component is a root node, on component mount, by default its flow will
transition from `exited` to `entering` to `entered` and stay there.

If the component is a child node, it will always listen to its closest parent node
flow state to know when it should transition. See more in
[Nesting Animators](/develop/animation/nesting).

Normally, the root nodes are managed using its instance settings, and the children
nodes are delegated to its parents nodes.

## Instance Settings

An animated component when it is used, it can receive an `animator` settings
object to configure declaratively its animator.

The root nodes can receive a the property `animator.activate` to determine
when it should enter or exit the animation flow. This in turn will manage
its delegated children nodes accordingly.

In the example of the `<Button/>` component, it could receive instance
settings like:

```tsx
import { AnimatorInstanceSettings, ... } from '@arwes/animation';

// ...

const instanceSettings: AnimatorInstanceSettings = {
  // true to make the component transition in.
  // false to make the component transition out.
  activate: true
};

// ...

<Button animator={instanceSettings}>
  My Animated Button
</Button>

// ...
```

A complete example using the `<Button/>` component as a root node can look
like this:

```arwes_sandbox
function ButtonComponent (props) {
  const buttonRef = React.useRef();
  props.animator.setupAnimateRefs(buttonRef);
  return (
    <button ref={buttonRef} style={{ opacity: 0 }}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}

const duration = { enter: 200, exit: 200 };

function useAnimateEntering (animator, buttonRef) {
  anime({
    targets: buttonRef.current,
    duration: animator.duration.enter,
    easing: 'linear',
    opacity: [0, 1]
  });
}

function useAnimateExiting (animator, buttonRef) {
  anime({
    targets: buttonRef.current,
    duration: animator.duration.enter,
    easing: 'linear',
    opacity: [1, 0]
  });
}

const Button = withAnimator({
  duration,
  useAnimateEntering,
  useAnimateExiting
})(ButtonComponent);

function App () {
  const [activate, setActivate] = React.useState(true);
  const timeout = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    timeout.current = setTimeout(() => setActivate(!activate), 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeout.current);
  }, [activate]);

  return (
    <Button animator={{ activate }}>
      My Button
    </Button>
  );
}

render(<App />);
```

It will update the component flow activation every 2 seconds.

Since it is an animated component, by default, its flow will be `exited`. Then
if it is activated, it will transition from `exited` to `entering` to `entered`.
When it transitions to `entering`, the hook `useAnimateEntering` will be called.

When it is deactivated, it will transition from `entered` to `exiting` to `exited`.
When it transitions to `exiting`, the hook `useAnimateExiting` will be called.

The component should set the initial styles of the animator animations changes.
In this case, the component is set to `opacity: 0` when it is `exited` in the
animation. Since its initial value is `exited` and the hooks are not executed,
the component should set the initial CSS styles to `opacity: 0` too for
consistency.

When an animated components exits, it is not unmounted.

When [nesting animators](/develop/animation/nesting), the children nodes will
listen to their parent nodes so there is not management needed for them, it would
be automatically handled by the animation tools.

## General Settings

Usually, the application animated components would have certain similar settings
for consistency. The available general settings can be provided using the
`<AnimatorGeneralProvider/>` provider.

For example, to provide common animator durations to all animated children nodes,
something like this can be done:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { AnimatorGeneralProvider, AnimatorGeneralProviderSettings } from '@arwes/animation';

const animatorGeneralSettings: AnimatorGeneralProviderSettings = {
  duration: { enter: 200, exit: 100 }
};

// ...

<AnimatorGeneralProvider animator={animatorGeneralSettings}>
  {/* ... */}
</AnimatorGeneralProvider>

// ...
```

## Suspend On Visibility Change

Some HTML animation libraries like [animejs](https://animejs.com) pause the
animations when the browser window looses focus. In animejs this behavior
can be disabled using:

```tsx
import anime from 'animejs';

anime.suspendWhenDocumentHidden = false;
```

You can see more at [anime - suspend on visibility change](https://animejs.com/documentation/#visibilitychange).
