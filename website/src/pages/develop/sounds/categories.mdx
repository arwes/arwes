# Bleeps Categories

The bleeps in an application can be configured by predefined categories.
Each category can have the audio settings which will be applicable to the
respective bleeps. This can allow the user to have different
audio settings for the application experience.

An example application with audio settings by categories can look like:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import {
  BleepsProvider,
  BleepsAudioSettings,
  BleepsPlayersSettings,
  BleepsSettings
} from '@arwes/sounds';

const audioSettings: BleepsAudioSettings = {
  common: {
    volume: 0.75
  },
  categories: {
    interaction: {
      volume: 0.5
    },
    notification: {
      volume: 1
    }
  }
};

const playersSettings: BleepsPlayersSettings = {
  click: {
    src: ['/path/to/sounds/click.webm']
  },
  warning: {
    src: ['/path/to/sounds/warning.webm']
  }
};

const bleepsSettings: BleepsSettings = {
  click: {
    player: 'click',
    category: 'interaction'
  },
  warning: {
    player: 'warning',
    category: 'notification'
  }
};

const App: FC = ({ children }) => (
  <BleepsProvider
    audioSettings={audioSettings}
    playersSettings={playersSettings}
    bleepsSettings={bleepsSettings}
  >
    {children}
  </BleepsProvider>
);
```

All bleeps would start with a volume of `0.75`. If they are `interaction` bleeps,
volume is `0.5`, and if they are `notification` bleeps, volume is `1`.

The categories can also be disabled with `disabled: true`.

The following predefined categories are available:

- `background` - For components low volume background effects.
- `transition` - For animation flow transitions.
- `interaction` - For user events such as mouse clicks.
- `notification` - For application events such as real-time chat messages.

It is recommended to allow the user to update the audio settings by categories
in the application.
