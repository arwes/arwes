# Sound Accessibility

A web page with interface sounds effects should not be intrusive to the
user. Certain Arwes applications may make the user expect sounds effects implicitely,
but this is not necessarily the default case. See the [UI/UX guidelines](/project/guidelines)
where some recommendations are made.

Since [Chrome Audio Autoplay Policies](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/11/web-audio-autoplay)
block the sound playback on window load until first user interaction, it is not
recommended to play sounds on window start time. Only after first user interaction.

By default, [howlerjs](https://howlerjs.com) will try to unlock the browser
sound playback on window load. In case audio is locked, this will queue all sound
playbacks before it was unlocked and play them when it is unlocked. This behavior
is not recommended and it can be disabled:

```tsx
import howler from 'howler';

howler.autoUnlock = false;
```

In this case, only sounds after browser audio is unlocked are reproduced.
So the sounds can be played normally and they will be reproduced only if allowed
without throwing erros if audio playback is locked.

If the application requires to play sounds as normal user experience, it is
recommended to "explicitely" request permission from the user, such as showing
a start page with a button to request access before accessing to the application.

The sounds tools allow the programmer to define if the sounds are enabled,
the sound volume, and the rate of playback. It also allows to set settings
by [categories of sounds](/develop/sounds/categories). It is recommended to show
the user a settings panel where to configure these behaviors.
