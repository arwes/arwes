# SciFi UI Framework

Arwes is a web framework to build user interfaces for
web applications based on science fiction and cyberpunk styles guidelines, animations
and sounds effects. The idea is to **provide an user experience as if you were using
futuristic out of a movie interfaces** for your project.

The tools are based on [React](https://reactjs.org) for components,
[JSS](http://cssinjs.org) for styles,
[react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) for
animations, [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/) for sounds and [Prism](http://prismjs.com)
for code highlighting.

> Currently is under development with an alpha version available on npm. API may change.

See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/romelperez/arwes) or
[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arwes).

## Get Started

Let's create a simple example with
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app):

```bash
$ create-react-app example
```

Now let's install Arwes:

```bash
$ cd example
$ npm install --save arwes
```

Images and sounds are not provided, if you want to use the assets implemented in the docs,
download them from the static folder in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/romelperez/arwes).

Once installed, enter to the folder and empty the `src/index.js` to start
from scratch.
