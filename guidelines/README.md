## Purpose

Arwes is an intent to materialize futuristic science fiction concepts in a toolset
to let you create interfaces that inspire advanced technology, especially spatial,
influenced by alien conceptions.

Connected, augmented, and energized are the feelings sought in the experiences
provided with projects built with Arwes. So the interfaces are intensive and rich.

But building modular, configurable, heavy animated and interconnected interface
components for web applications from both design and functional perspectives
it's not easy. Since there are plenty of ideas where to get inspiration, the
concepts used here are opinionated and focus on certain aspects to experience.

These are the main fundamental ideas behind this project.

### Advanced Alien Technology

### Sleek and Clean

### Functional

### Energetic and Vibrant
