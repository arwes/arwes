## Purpose

Arwes intends to materialize futuristic science fiction concepts in a toolset
you may use to create interfaces inspired by advanced technology, especially spatial,
influenced by alien conceptions.

Connected, augmented, and energized are the feelings sought in the experiences provided by projects built with Arwes, so Arwes interfaces are intensive and rich.

But building modular, configurable, heavily animated, and interconnected interface
components for web applications from both design and functional perspectives
is not easy. Since there are plenty of places from which we could draw inspiration, the
concepts implemented in Arwes are opinionated and focused on certain experiential aspects.

These are the main fundamental ideas behind this project:

### Advanced Alien Technology

Arwes elements should looks like they were made with advanced technology based on
many fundamentally new scientific theories and created by developed alien
civilizations or human societies millennia away in the future.

But written and spoken languages with letters and numbers are still the primary means of communication,
and mechanical interactions are still needed to manipulate  controls.

Arwes design could be used in displays, virtual reality, augmented reality, and
even holograms, and it should give users the impression that they are controlling sophisticated futuristic devices.

### Clean and Sleek

Design doesn't have to be cryptic to feel advanced. Elements should be shown clearly
enough to express ideas without getting lost in visual effects.

Sizes and spacing should be used properly to convey messages clearly. Controls and structural
elements should not be too big just because they are important. Content should be legible and
not convoluted or obfuscated.

Arwes interfaces should look polished and sophisticated.

### Functional

The elements in the experience should exist for a purpose, not just for display.
But they can be elaborated. These elements should express that they have a function.

All components in an experience should feel they are interconnected as a whole,
so the experience is not just functional, but intelligent. Actions in one place can echo in
other places or even broadcast to the whole system.

### Energetic and Vibrant

All components should connect with the user visually and aurally. By navigating,
things shouldn't just appear or disappear; they should feel as if they are being assembled, evolved,
and decomposed. The experience of using them should be that of an explorer and also a
creator.

Glowing elements should inspire energy and animation should activate it. Users
should feel connected with the system.

## Design System

Arwes is a _framework_ to create UIs. Ideally, most settings should be configurable.
So many of these guidelines should be flexible enough to adapt to the implementation
desired.

### Colors

Futuristic designs tend to be dark. Arwes is not an exception, it is specially
designed for dark backgrounds and light elements. But it could be configured
to meet alternative requirements.

#### Color Usage

### Fonts

The typographies tend to be rectangular and maybe oblique with techno influence.

Text, as any other content, should have the ability to "glow". This effect is
achieved with `text-shadow` and it is defined according to the type of content
and user interaction.

Arwes defines three main typographies: Headings, content, and code. You can
configure all of them along with their scales.

The project uses [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
and [Electrolize](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Electrolize).

## Animation and Sound System

Any element in the system can use animations for many purposes, as individual elements
or sub-systems of elements.

Sounds can be played when animations run.

When multiple elements play the same sound at the same time, the sound is played
only once. If a sound is playing and another element tries to play it again,
the sound restarts.

### Transitions

When an element transitions in the system, it should be built. It should
feel as being created part by part. A simple line will start as a point and
get its final length over a short period of time. Opacity can be used from 0 to 1
while animating but should last very short in the beginning of the animation.

When an element transitions out of the system, it should be disassembled. It should
feel as if it is being unmounted part by part. A simple line will shrink until it is a point
in a short period of time. Opacity can be used from 1 to 0 while animating, but
should last very short at the end of the animation.

Elements transitioning in and out can have a sound effect lasting the time the
animations take.

When a system transitions in, elements should transition in by their order of
depth: First backgrounds, then structural frames, then containers, and finally
content. All elements in the same depth start transitioning in at the same time
and should take the same duration. A typical system can take up to 5 levels of
depth.

When a system transitions out, all elements regardless of their level of depth,
should start transitioning out at the same time and should take the same duration.

### Persisting

In a system, once it is created and shown, it can run randomly subtle passive
animations on its elements every dozen seconds with very optional sounds.

Lines in a rectangular container can glow momentary once in a while in a system.
A background can be animated the whole time with subtle changes and low dim music
can be played in the duration of the system.

But these animations shouldn't be intrusive. User shouldn't be distracted from primary
content.

### Interactions

When a user interacts with elements in the system, the elements can affect themselves,
such as a toggle (changing from on to off and vice-versa), or they can affect a sub-system,
such as expanding information on hover or transitioning to another system.

For subtle interactions, like hovering an element or typing a key, subtle animations
and sounds can be played. These shouldn't bring too much attention.

For decisive interactions, like selecting an option or typing enter, more concise
animations and sounds can be played. These should bring attention.
